    <h1><em>Design philosophy and features</em></h1>
    
    <p>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Design_philosophy_and_features" target="_blank">Design philosophy and features of Python</a><hr></p>
    
    <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming[<sub><strong>57</strong></sub>] and metaobjects.[58] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[<sub><strong>60</strong></sub>] and logic programming.[<sub><strong>61</strong></sub>] Python is often referred to as a 'glue language'[<sub>62</sub>] because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages. <br>
    Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[63] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
    <br>
    Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the "Lisp tradition". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[64] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[<sup><strong>65</strong></sup>]
    <br>
    Python's core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:[<sup><strong>66</strong></sup>]
    <br><hr><pre>
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.</pre><hr><br>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. However, Python have received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat.[67] Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[68] The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.[<sup><strong>69</strong></sup>][<sup><strong>70</strong></sup>]
    <br>
    Nevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.[<sup><strong>42</strong></sup>]
